# Anastomosis
Anastomosis is a peer-reviewed journal, operated by volunteer scientists whom carefully select not yet published research, essays and journalism related to the broad subject of networks. Topics within the subject of network science can be from any discipline from computer science topics such as computer networks, decentralized software, cryptocurrency to biology topics such as mycology and neuroscience.

Anastomosis utlizes an open submission system, encouraging everyone from first-time authors to researchers to  participate.

Anastomosis falls into a category of scientific literature often called "gray literature", a term used to describe a wide variety of literature that is not published by traditional commerical, academic publishing. 

Recognizing the myriad of problems associated with the current academic publishing model we believe instead of investing time to reform the existing system, we are able to enact more change by introducing a new open standard, building open source publishing tools and creating high quality publications using these the new standards.

We believe a new open standard can be used to define a subset of "gray literature" that we would like to be called "open research publishing". It is an open standard, meaning there is no single definition and interpretations vary with usage. The three key ideas of open research publishing are transparency, public availability or usability and public accessibility. 

## Open Research Publishing
Open research publishing is the open standard actively being defined by participants publishing open access research. The standard seeks to address the common problems associated gray literature publications, to increase quality and longevity of accessibility.

### Bibliographic Control
A minimum requirement must be established that allows anonymous publications while providing enough information to provide meaningful bibliographic control.

### Formating and Layouts An open standard for formatting and layouts must be established that present published work inline with existing trends in professional publications. Open and free layouts which meet this standard must be made available.

### Electronic Publishing 
All publications under the open research standard must us free and open electronic publishing formats such as EPUB.

A variety of methods to address problems with longevity and provide permanent archival of publications will need to be developed. Development of open source tools using blockchains, mainline DHT, or new peer-to-peer software to both archive and guarantee accessibility. Technological solutions should be in combination with leveraging existing systems like the Internet Archive or academic institutions to store open research publications. Operating as a decentralized organization will help address some of the problems with longevity that electronic publishers can be subject to.

To resolve issues of longevity related to link-rot a persistent unique identification system must be used that can resolve a unique identifier to a usable and updatable URL. Development of an open decentralized identifier system utilizing a DHT or leveraging blockchains is most preferred but until such a system can be implemented all articles published under the open research standard must be assigned a [digital object identifier (DOI)[http://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html].

### Licensing & Copyright
All articles published should be accessible "without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself."

This may be accomplished using a variety of methods from releasing the article as public domain or using standard licenses like Creative Commons Attribution License. 
 
### Databases
As a way to provide a guarantee of accessibility open research publishes should provide a searchable database of published articles or work with existing open access databases to release increase accessibility of publications.

#### Resources
As more scientists recognize the role of open source software on the advancement of computer science, increasingly scientists in other scientific disciplines are becomming interested in the concept of open science and associated topics. A growing amount of resources are being available to scientists, researchers and publishers interested in open science; anyone interested in open science should familiarize themselves with the existing resources.
